# Dabdoob

**Dabdoob** is a cross-platform launcher and content manager for [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA) and its forks, such as [Cataclysm: The Last Generation](https://github.com/Cataclysm-TLG/Cataclysm-TLG/) and [Cataclysm: Bright Nights](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN). It is based on [qrrk's Catapult launcher](https://github.com/qrrk/Catapult) to resume its development and to create the "perfect" launcher that does everything you could hope for.

- The Dabdoob executable [should have execution permission enabled](https://askubuntu.com/a/485001).
- The game needs the following dependencies, Some distros come with these preinstalled, but others don't.: `sdl2`, `sdl2_image`, `sdl2_ttf`, `sdl2_mixer`, `freetype2`, `zip`
    - On Debian based distros (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.): `sudo apt install libsdl2-image libsdl2-ttf libsdl2-mixer libfreetype6 zip`
